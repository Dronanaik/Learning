Topic name: Introduction to Attention and Language Models
Date: 2025-05-17
Description:
- 2001 : First Neural Language Model : Predic future words in a  sentence 
- 2013 : Large scale Bag of Words : CBOW(Continuous Bag of Word),Skip-gram, Direct and Indirect Bias.
- 2013/2014 :  RNNs and CNNs for NLP
- 2014 : Sequence to sequence models : Encoder ,Decoder
- 2015 : Attention :Compressing into a fixed vector limits memory, but attention helps the decoder by giving direct access to all encoder outputs.
- 2017 : Transformers : 'Attention is all you need' 
- There are two types of Language models: 1)Auto-regressive 2)Auto-encoding
- Auto-regressive: Goal is to predict a future token, Use case: Natural Language Generator, GPT Family
- Auto-encoding : Goal is to learn representation of the  entire sequence, Use case: Natural Language Understanding(NLU), BERT
- Transformers can perform both Auto-regressive and Auto-encoding tasks
