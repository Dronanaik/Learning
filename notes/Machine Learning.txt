Topic name: Decision Trees  
Date: 2025-05-12  
Description:
- Decision Trees are a supervised learning method used for both classification and regression tasks.
- They split the dataset into subsets based on feature values, building a tree structure.
- Each internal node represents a test on an attribute, each branch a result, and each leaf a class label or output.
- Popular algorithms include ID3, C4.5, and CART.
- Overfitting is a common issue; pruning techniques help mitigate it.
- Decision Trees are intuitive and easy to visualize but sensitive to noisy data.

Topic name: Logistic Regression
Date: 2025-05-15
Description:
- Logistic Regression is a classification algorithm used to predict the probability of a binary outcome.
- It uses the sigmoid function to map predicted values between 0 and 1.
- The model estimates parameters using Maximum Likelihood Estimation.
- Common evaluation metrics include accuracy, precision, recall, and ROC-AUC score.
- It is widely used in applications like spam detection, medical diagnosis, and credit scoring.

Topic name: Support Vector Machines (SVM)
Date: 2025-05-17
Description:
- SVM is a powerful classification algorithm that finds the optimal hyperplane separating data into classes.
- It maximizes the margin between the closest points of different classes (support vectors).
- Kernel functions allow SVM to operate in high-dimensional or infinite-dimensional spaces.
- Common kernels include linear, polynomial, and radial basis function (RBF).
- It is effective in high-dimensional spaces and text classification.
- Training time can be high for large datasets, and it’s sensitive to the choice of kernel and parameters.

Topic name: Naive Bayes Classifier
Date: 2025-05-18
Description:
- Naive Bayes is a probabilistic classifier based on Bayes’ Theorem with the “naive” assumption of independence between features.
- It works well with high-dimensional input data and is widely used for text classification.
- Variants include Gaussian, Multinomial, and Bernoulli Naive Bayes.
- It is fast, simple, and performs surprisingly well even with its strong assumptions.
- It struggles when features are highly correlated.
- Common use cases include spam detection, sentiment analysis, and document categorization.
